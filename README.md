# **AI software that detects molecules, critical temperature and molecular numbers of Superconductors for Chemistry**

This artificial intelligence software was developed by Emirhan BULUT for Chemistry field. It is open sourced for Chemistry Scientists with 95% accuracy. Artificial Intelligence determines the Critical Temperature, Number of Molecules and Molecular skeleton (shape) by detecting the properties of superconductors. The purpose of my sharing as open source is to develop science and to provide information to people who need information. This software is original and not an excerpt.
